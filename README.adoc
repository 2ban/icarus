This repository is home of a sidecar for Apache Cassandra database. Sidecar is meant to be run alongside of Cassandra instance
and sidecar talks to Cassandra via JMX.

Sidecar JAR is also integrating backup-restore solution of Instaclustr seamlessly so it might be used in two modes -
either as a long-running server application which responds to clients requests or as a CLI application via which one
can backup / restore a Cassandra node.

=== Usage

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar cassandra-sidecar-1.0.0.jar
Missing required sub-command.
Usage: <main class> [-hV] [COMMAND]
  -h, --help      Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version   Print version information and exit.
Commands:
  backup-restore     Application for backup and restore of a Cassandra node.
  cassandra-sidecar  Sidecar management application for Cassandra.
----

If you use `backup-restore`, you will have the same functionality as if you were using our backup / restore CLI.

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar cassandra-sidecar-1.0.0.jar backup-restore help
Usage: <main class> backup-restore [-hV] [COMMAND]
Application for backup and restore of a Cassandra node.
  -h, --help      Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version   Print version information and exit.
Commands:
  backup             Take a snapshot of a Cassandra node and upload it to remote storage. Defaults to a snapshot of all
                       keyspaces and their column families, but may be restricted to specific keyspaces or a single
                       column-family.
  restore            Restore the Cassandra data on this node to a specified point-in-time.
  commitlog-backup   Upload archived commit logs to remote storage.
  commitlog-restore  Restores archived commit logs to node.
----

On the other hand, if you use server mode, there will be HTTP REST server started.

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar cassandra-sidecar-1.0.0.jar cassandra-sidecar
----

=== REST interface

Sidecar server application accepts JSON body. Each operation we want to do against Cassandra has corresponding JSON
payload. In turn, sidecar takes this body and calls respective JMX method to invoke it.

There are currently these operations:

* cleanup
* decommission
* drain
* flush
* rebuild
* refresh
* restart
* scrub
* upgradesstables

Lets say we want to execute flushing operation which flushes memtables into sstables. You have to send this
payload to `http://127.0.0.1:4567/operations`

[source,json]
----
{
	"type": "flush",
	"keyspace": "mykeyspace",
	"tables": [
	    "table1", "table2"
	]
}
----

=== Build

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean install
----

By default, there is `singleNode` profile enabled which tests this Sidecar by invoking only operations which are
isolated to one node only. The other profile is `multiNode` which is starting multiple embedded Cassandra instances.
For example, a decomission test is a multiNode test. In order to successfully run `multiNode` tests,
there has to be interface `127.0.0.2` available on the host.
